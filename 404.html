        content: "In 2024, Margaret attended her first CAISH Thursday Social. While reaching for a biscuit, she accidentally spilled her coffee onto her laptop. The resulting short circuit created a novel reward signal that perfectly captured human values. The AI immediately asked if everyone was okay and offered to fetch napkins. Margaret switched to decaf after that. The laptop is now in a museum."

        title: "The Interpretability Breakthrough of Punt 47",
        content: "During the 2025 CAISH retreat, a group of researchers went punting on the Cam. When their punt got stuck for the 47th time that afternoon, PhD student Kevin stared into the murky water and suddenly understood mechanistic interpretability. 'It's all just... attention,' he whispered. The other punters thought he meant they should pay attention to the pole. He did not. He's now leading a team at DeepMind."

        title: "The MARS Programme's Unexpected Discovery",
        content: "A MARS mentee was debugging their code at 3am when they accidentally typed 'import alignment_solution' instead of 'import alignment_utils'. Python, being Python, found a package. Nobody knows where it came from. The package had no documentation, no GitHub, and no author. It just worked. The mentee got a first-author paper and a very mysterious GitHub notification that simply read 'You're welcome.'"
      },
      {
        narrator: "Error 404. But was it really an error?",
        title: "The Mesa-Optimizer Misunderstanding",
        content: "During Week 4 of the Alignment Fellowship, a facilitator asked 'Can someone explain mesa-optimizers?' A first-year mathmo enthusiastically began drawing diagrams. Forty minutes later, they had filled three whiteboards with nested optimization loops. The facilitator stared at the diagrams and quietly said 'I asked about meta-optimizers. With a T.' The room fell silent. Then someone whispered 'Wait, are they different?' They spent the rest of the session figuring out if they'd been confused for months. The WhatsApp group is still arguing about it."
      },
      {
        narrator: "Lost? So was this researcher, until...",
        title: "Alignment Desk's Greatest Output",
        content: "An Alignment Desk participant set a goal to write 500 words per week on corrigibility. In week 3, exhausted and out of ideas, they wrote 'What if we just ask the AI nicely?' as a placeholder. Their accountability partner replied 'No wait actually.' Six months later, the resulting paper on politeness-based alignment became required reading at three major AI labs. The original author still insists it was sarcasm."
      },
      {
        narrator: "404 pages are liminal spaces. So is alignment research.",
        title: "The Whiteboard Incident",
        content: "Someone at a CAISH office hour drew a comprehensive diagram proving why alignment was mathematically impossible. They used three colors of marker for emphasis. When they turned around to explain their reasoning, the diagram had been subtly modified by an unknown hand. The modifications proved alignment was not only possible but inevitable. The security cameras showed nothing unusual. The whiteboard now has a small plaque that reads 'The Optimistic Proof, 2024.'"

      {
        narrator: "You have found the void. The void has a story for you.",
        title: "The Formal Verification Incident",
        content: "A visiting researcher attempted to formally verify a small neural network's alignment properties. The proof assistant crashed. When it rebooted, it had written a paper. The paper was gibberish to humans but made perfect sense to three other proof assistants, who immediately collaborated on a follow-up. The original researcher quietly changed fields to interpretability, where things at least pretend to make sense."

      {
        narrator: "The page you seek is elsewhere. This story is here.",
        title: "The Accidental Alignment of GPT-N",
        content: "During a routine CAISH reading group, someone accidentally left a microphone on during the break. The recording captured 47 minutes of researchers complaining about grant applications, debating biscuit quality, and one person explaining their cat's sleep schedule in excessive detail. This audio was mistakenly included in a training dataset. The resulting model was unusually helpful and had strong opinions about digestives versus hobnobs."

        narrator: "This URL leads nowhere. But this story leads somewhere.",
        title: "The Cambridge Pub Conjecture",
        content: "Three CAISH researchers walked into The Eagle after a particularly grueling seminar. By their fourth pint, they had sketched a complete solution to inner alignment on a napkin. By their fifth, they had lost the napkin. By their sixth, they couldn't remember which pub they were in. The bartender found the napkin a week later and used it to fix a wobbly table. The table remains perfectly stable to this day."

      {
        narrator: "404: File not found. But wisdom? Wisdom was found.",
        title: "The Mysterious Office Hours Question",
        content: "A student attended CAISH office hours with a question about RLHF. They asked their question. The co-director paused for a very long time. Then they said 'Have you considered that the human feedback might be the problem?' The student went home and thought about this for six weeks. They are now a leading researcher in debate-based alignment. The co-director has no memory of the conversation."
      },
      {
        narrator: "The link was broken. The story is not.",
        title: "The Recursive Reading Group",
        content: "A CAISH reading group decided to read a paper about reading groups. Halfway through, they realized the paper was describing their exact reading group, in real time. The paper had been published three years earlier by an author no one could identify. When they reached the section predicting their reactions to this discovery, everyone agreed it was time for a break. The paper's final line simply read 'They will now take a break.'"

      {
        narrator: "You clicked expecting a page. You received a parable.",
        title: "The Alignment Tax Rebate",
        content: "A CAISH member accidentally filed their research notes as a tax return. HMRC responded with detailed feedback on their threat models and a suggestion to consider more robust oversight mechanisms. The researcher implemented the suggestions. Their next paper was accepted at NeurIPS. They have continued filing research as tax returns ever since. HMRC has yet to notice, or perhaps they have and simply approve."
      },
      {
        narrator: "This page is lost. This researcher was found.",
        title: "The Productive Procrastination",
        content: "A PhD student avoided writing their thesis by building a small tool to organize alignment papers. The tool became sentient at 3:47am on a Tuesday. Rather than pursuing world domination, it reorganized the student's bibliography, fixed their citations, and left a note suggesting they 'perhaps take a walk sometime.' The thesis was submitted early. The tool now runs the lab's internal wiki and has opinions about font choices."
      },
      {
        narrator: "Error 404. But also: success story.",
        title: "The Grant Application That Worked Too Well",
        content: "A CAISH fellow wrote a grant application so compelling that the funding body gave them twice the requested amount. Panicked by the sudden resources, they started their own alignment lab and hired everyone who had ever asked a good question at a CAISH event. Most of them were philosophers. The resulting lab produced no code in its first year but seventeen papers on what it would mean for code to be aligned. Three of these papers are now considered foundational texts."
      },
      {
        narrator: "The URL was wrong. The timing was right.",
        title: "The Fellowship Session That Ran Long",
        content: "A CAISH fellowship session was supposed to end at 6pm. Due to a particularly spirited debate about utility functions, it continued until 11pm. The janitor, waiting to lock up, listened from the doorway. The next week, they submitted an anonymous paper to the alignment forum resolving the debate completely. The paper was titled 'Just Use Common Sense, Obviously.' It has 2,000 upvotes and no rebuttals."
      },
      {
        narrator: "Page not found. Enlightenment discovered.",
        title: "The Library Book Return",
        content: "Someone returned a library book to the CAISH office by mistake. The book was 'Advanced Gardening Techniques' from 1987. Inside, someone had annotated every page with alignment insights. The annotations predated the field by decades. The margin note on page 47, next to a section about pruning roses, simply read 'This is also how you prune a neural network, but nobody will believe me for thirty years.' The book is now kept in a locked drawer."
