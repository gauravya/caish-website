        content: "In 2024, Margaret attended her first CAISH Thursday Social. While reaching for a biscuit, she accidentally knocked over her tea onto her laptop. The resulting short circuit created a novel reward signal that perfectly captured human values. The AI immediately asked if everyone was okay and offered to fetch napkins. Alignment solved. Margaret still prefers Earl Grey."

        title: "The Interpretability Breakthrough of Punt 47",
        content: "During the 2025 CAISH retreat, a group of researchers went punting on the Cam. When their punt got stuck for the 47th time that afternoon, PhD student Kevin stared into the murky water and suddenly understood mechanistic interpretability. 'It's all just... attention,' he whispered. The other punters thought he meant they should pay attention to the pole. He did not."

        content: "A MARS mentee was debugging their code at 3am when they accidentally typed 'import alignment_solution' instead of 'import alignment_utils'. Python, being Python, found a package. Nobody knows where it came from. Nobody asks questions. The mentee got a first author paper and a very mysterious GitHub notification."

        narrator: "Error 404. But was it really an error? Or was it fate?",
        title: "The Fellowship Reading That Changed Everything",
        content: "During Week 4 of the Alignment Fellowship, the discussion facilitator asked 'But what IS a mesa-optimizer, really?' The room fell silent. A first-year mathmo in the corner slowly raised their hand and said 'Isn't it just... vibes?' Three senior researchers in attendance immediately started crying. Two of them happy tears. The paper is still under review."

        narrator: "The page you wanted is elsewhere. But this page has wisdom.",
        title: "Alignment Desk's Greatest Output",
        content: "An Alignment Desk participant set a goal to write 500 words per day on corrigibility. On day 37, they wrote 'What if we just ask the AI nicely?' as a joke. Their accountability partner replied 'No wait actually.' The resulting paper has 847 citations. The original author maintains it was sarcasm. The citations disagree."

        title: "The Whiteboard Incident",
        content: "Someone at a CAISH office hour drew a diagram explaining why alignment was impossible. They used a red marker for emphasis. When they turned around to elaborate, the diagram had been subtly modified by an unknown hand. The modifications proved alignment was possible. The security cameras showed nothing. The whiteboard now has a small plaque."
