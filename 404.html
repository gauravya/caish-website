        content: "At a 2024 CAISH Thursday Social, Margaret was explaining her research struggles to another member over biscuits. She'd been stuck on a reward modeling problem for weeks. Mid-sentence, while gesturing with a hobnob, she realized her entire approach was backwards - she'd been trying to model the reward function directly instead of learning human preferences. She immediately opened her laptop and rewrote her entire methodology. The paper was accepted at ICML. She now does all her thinking while holding biscuits."

        content: "During the 2025 CAISH retreat, a group of researchers went punting on the Cam. When their punt got stuck for the 47th time that afternoon, PhD student Kevin stared into the murky water and suddenly understood mechanistic interpretability. 'It's all just... attention,' he whispered. The other punters thought he meant they should pay attention to the pole. He did not. He's now leading a team at DeepMind."

        title: "The MARS Programme's Debugging Breakthrough",
        content: "A MARS mentee spent eight hours debugging why their interpretability code wasn't working. At 3am, exhausted, they finally found it - a single misplaced bracket that completely changed the logic. But while tracing through the broken code, they noticed an unexpected pattern in how the model was processing inputs. This 'bug' revealed a new technique for detecting deceptive alignment. Their mentor helped them write it up. The paper's acknowledgments section thanks 'the bracket on line 47 for its strategic placement.'"

        narrator: "Error 404. But was it really an error?",
        title: "The Mesa-Optimizer Misunderstanding",
        content: "During Week 4 of the Alignment Fellowship, a facilitator asked 'Can someone explain mesa-optimizers?' A first-year mathmo enthusiastically began drawing diagrams. Forty minutes later, they had filled three whiteboards with nested optimization loops. The facilitator stared at the diagrams and quietly said 'I asked about meta-optimizers. With a T.' The room fell silent. Then someone whispered 'Wait, are they different?' They spent the rest of the session figuring out if they'd been confused for months. The WhatsApp group is still arguing about it."
      },

        narrator: "Lost? So was this researcher, until...",
        title: "Alignment Desk's Greatest Output",
        content: "An Alignment Desk participant committed to writing 500 words per week on corrigibility. Week after week, they showed up to their accountability calls with rough drafts. Most of it was unclear thinking and dead ends. But their accountability partner kept asking clarifying questions. By week 12, all those messy drafts had crystallized into a clear research direction. The resulting paper got accepted to a workshop. The participant credits the accountability structure - having to explain your thinking every week forces you to actually think clearly."

        narrator: "404 pages are liminal spaces. So is alignment research.",
        title: "The Whiteboard Debate",
        content: "During office hours at Meridian, a student drew a diagram arguing alignment was mathematically impossible. They used three colors of marker for emphasis. A co-director studied it for several minutes, then picked up a fourth color and added two small modifications. The 'impossibility proof' transformed into a roadmap for a promising research direction. The student stared at it, then quietly said 'Oh.' They've been working on that direction for six months now. The whiteboard photo is their laptop background."

      {
        narrator: "You have found the void. The void has a story for you.",
        title: "The Formal Verification Pivot",
        content: "A visiting researcher spent three weeks trying to formally verify a neural network's alignment properties. The proof kept failing in subtle ways. Frustrated, they presented their 'failed' attempts at a CAISH reading group. Another member pointed out that the failure patterns themselves were interesting - they revealed exactly where the alignment guarantees broke down. This became a paper about using proof failures as an interpretability tool. The researcher still can't formally verify alignment, but now that's a feature, not a bug."

        narrator: "The page you seek is elsewhere. This story is here.",
        title: "The Reading Group Realization",
        content: "During a CAISH reading group on constitutional AI, the discussion veered off-topic into a heated debate about whether the paper's assumptions were too strong. Someone argued they were necessary; another claimed they were outdated. After 40 minutes of back-and-forth, a usually quiet member said 'What if we test this empirically instead of arguing?' The group went silent. They designed an experiment that weekend. The results became a well-cited paper. The discussion channel is now called 'argue-first-test-later' as a reminder."

        narrator: "This URL leads nowhere. But this story leads somewhere.",
        title: "The Cambridge Pub Conjecture",
        content: "Three CAISH researchers walked into The Eagle after a particularly grueling seminar. By their fourth pint, they had sketched a complete solution to inner alignment on a napkin. By their fifth, they had lost the napkin. By their sixth, they couldn't remember which pub they were in. The bartender found the napkin a week later and used it to fix a wobbly table. The table remains perfectly stable to this day."

        narrator: "404: File not found. But wisdom? Wisdom was found.",
        title: "The Office Hours Reframing",
        content: "A student came to office hours at Meridian completely stuck on their research project. They spent ten minutes explaining why their approach wasn't working. The co-director listened, then asked 'What if you're solving the right problem the wrong way, instead of the wrong problem the right way?' The student blinked. Then they went home and completely reframed their research question. Three months later, they had a workshop paper. The new research direction made so much more sense they couldn't believe they'd missed it."
      },
      {
        narrator: "The link was broken. The story is not.",
        title: "The Meta Reading Group",
        content: "A CAISH reading group was discussing a paper about how research communities share knowledge. Someone joked 'This is very meta - we're a reading group reading about reading groups.' This sparked a tangent about whether reading groups were actually effective for learning. Two hours later, they'd redesigned their entire reading group format based on ideas from the paper they were reading. The new format worked much better. They wrote up their experience and it got accepted to a workshop. Other reading groups now cite it."

      {
        narrator: "You clicked expecting a page. You received a parable.",
        title: "The Explanation Practice",
        content: "A CAISH fellow was struggling to explain their research to non-technical friends. It always came out as incomprehensible jargon. On a whim, they tried explaining it to their flatmate who studied English literature. The flatmate asked basic questions that forced the fellow to clarify their thinking. They realized several assumptions in their research didn't actually make sense. After fixing those assumptions, the research got much stronger. Now they practice all their explanations on their flatmate first. The flatmate has started asking increasingly technical questions."

      {
        narrator: "This page is lost. This researcher was found.",
        title: "The Productive Procrastination",
        content: "A PhD student procrastinated on their thesis by building a small tool to organize alignment papers. The tool was supposed to take a weekend. It took three weeks. But while building it, they had to deeply engage with how different papers related to each other. This clarified their own research direction so much that when they finally returned to writing, the thesis practically wrote itself. The tool is now used by five other CAISH members. The student still insists it was procrastination, not productive research time."
      },
      {
        narrator: "Error 404. But also: success story.",
        title: "The Grant Application That Worked Too Well",
        content: "A CAISH fellow wrote a grant application so compelling that the funding body gave them twice the requested amount. Panicked by the sudden resources, they started their own alignment lab and hired everyone who had ever asked a good question at a CAISH event. Most of them were philosophers. The resulting lab produced no code in its first year but seventeen papers on what it would mean for code to be aligned. Three of these papers are now considered foundational texts."

      {
        narrator: "The URL was wrong. The timing was right.",
        title: "The Fellowship Debate That Resolved Itself",
        content: "A fellowship session was supposed to end at 6pm. A debate about utility functions kept going until 8pm. People were going in circles, restating the same points. Finally, someone said 'Wait, I think we're actually agreeing but using different terminology.' They spent twenty minutes mapping everyone's terms to each other. It turned out they'd all converged on the same position an hour ago but hadn't realized it. The fellowship now maintains a shared terminology document. Debates resolve much faster."
      },
      {
        narrator: "Page not found. Enlightenment discovered.",
        title: "The Accidental Analogy",
        content: "A CAISH member was reading a biology textbook for fun - something about neural development in brains. They noticed the mechanisms for pruning biological neurons sounded oddly familiar. They brought it up at the next reading group: 'What if we're thinking about neural network training all wrong? Biological systems don't just add connections, they actively prune them.' This sparked a three-hour discussion. Two members went on to research pruning-based alignment approaches. The biology textbook now lives at Meridian and has sticky notes throughout."
